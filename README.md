# Soarer's Converter (sctools)
In the old keyoard modding community (of which I am realatively new), there is a piece of technology called Soarer's Converter. I do not profess to know all about this topic - only enough to be dangerous and convert my old IBM M122 Battleship TX to USB-C. As such, I will be creating this repository for myself based on the tools I found helpful and used on the installation and configuration of my keyboard using my Ubuntu 24.04 OS based laptop. :)

### sctools
`sctools` is a repo that is popular for writing configuration files to your keyboard. This allows you to remap keys, create macros, and much more - the world is your oyster!
